3. Create a user registration
	- facebook oAuth
	- uncomment the authenticate_user method in activities controller


Design Notes:

In the console:
	rails g model User provider:string uid:string name:string
	rake db:migrate
	gem install omniauth-facebook
	bundle install
	rails g controller home index profile
	rails g controller sessions

In the gemfile add:
	gem 'omniauth-facebook', '~> 2.0.1'

In config/initializers:
	create a file called omniauth.rb that has the provider keys for facebook 
		Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do |variable|
			provider :facebook, 'app_ID', 'secret'
		end		
	add to .gitignore

In sessions_controller.rb:
	add create and destroy methods

In the user.rb model:
	add the sign_in and the create_user methods

In config/routes:
  root 'home#index'
  get 'home/profile'
  get 'auth/:provider/callback', to: "sessions#create"
  delete 'sign_out', to: "sessions#destroy", as: 'sign_out'

In application_controller.rb:
	create a method current_user

In application.html.erb:
	Add the information for logging in and the conditionals for if someone is logged in or not

In home_controller.rb
	create a before_action to set_auth
	create methods for index and profile
	create a private set_auth method
