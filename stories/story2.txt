2. Create a model and controller for activites index page
	- controller should have 
		- empty methods for search, index, show, new, edit, create, update, destroy
	-  private methods for activity_params and set_activity
		- activity prarams should include title, description, number of people, location, time or time range, images
	- before_actions of set_activity, authenticate_user (commented out for now)


Design Notes:

- To generate a new model/controller in the command line:
-- rails g scaffold Activity title:string description:text max_people:integer no_max:boolean zipcode:integer start_time:string end_time:string 
-- rake db:migrate
